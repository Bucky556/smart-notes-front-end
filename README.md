**📝 About Smart Notes Frontend**

Smart Notes Frontend is the user interface part of a note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes efficiently. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks.

Since I mainly handled the backend development, the UI design may not have the polish of a professional frontend designer. However, frontend JavaScript logic, API integration, form validation, pop-up system, pagination, favorite functionality, security checks, and notification badge are implemented by me.

**🎯 Key Features (Frontend / Edit Side)**
